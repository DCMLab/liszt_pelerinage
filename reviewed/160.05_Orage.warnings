FIRST_BAR_MISSING_TEMPO_MARK_WARNING (29,) ms3.Parse.liszt_pelerinage.16005_Orage
	No metronome mark found in the first measure nor anywhere else in the score.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 29, '1/2', 'VI6') ms3.Parse.liszt_pelerinage.16005_Orage
	The label 'VI6' in m. 28, onset 1/2 (MC 29, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of c.bII, it expresses the scale degrees
	('#1', '3', '6') [('D', 'F', 'Bb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 10 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.8333333333333334 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
